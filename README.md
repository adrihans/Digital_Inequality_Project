# Digital_Inequality_Project


### Goals:

For this project, I want to focus on Twitter participation and engagement during the French presidential campaign. 
To do that, I retrieved several types of data: tweets, publications from Factiva, time spent on media from ARCOM and polls, as listed below. 
I expect to find some correlations between each data types and to study what might be relevant, for instance using NLP tools, if it seems relevant.  

### Data Sources: 

- Tweets: 

Twitter, using the [Minet](https://github.com/medialab/minet) tool developed by the Medialab. 

- Factiva
- Arcom : [Source](https://www.csa.fr/csaelections/tempspresidentielle2022)  *"DONNÃ‰ES BRUTES DES TEMPS DE PAROLE ET D'ANTENNE"*
- Polls: [nsppolls](https://github.com/nsppolls/nsppolls) on GitHub.
